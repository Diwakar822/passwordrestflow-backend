PasswordResetFlow - Comprehensive User Authentication System

This project is a complete user authentication system designed to enhance security and user experience. The key features include:

Features:
User Registration

1. Users can create accounts with their email and a secure password.
2. Data validation to ensure all required fields are filled correctly.
  
 Login Functionality

1. Secure login system with hashed password verification.
2. Error handling for incorrect credentials or missing details.

 Password Reset Flow

1. Users can reset their password if forgotten.
2. A unique reset link is sent to the registered email address.
3. Links expire after a set time to ensure security.

Email Notifications using NodeMailer

1. Integration with NodeMailer to send password reset emails.
2. Configured with SMTP for reliable email delivery.

Tech Stack:
1. Backend: Node.js, Express.js
2. Email Service: NodeMailer
3. Database: MongoDB (or any other database of your choice)
4. Security: Bcrypt for hashing passwords, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management

 How It Works:
1. User registers by filling out the registration form.
2. On login, credentials are validated and a session token is issued.
3. If the password is forgotten:
4. The user requests a password reset.
5. NodeMailer sends a reset link to the registered email.
6. The link redirects to a secure page where the user can set a new password.

 Future Enhancements:
1. Add two-factor authentication for increased security.
2. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
3. Improve email templates for better user engagement.
